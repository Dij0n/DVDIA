# DVD Senior Project

My final project for Mathematics HL. This Processing.js program simulates a DVD screensaver bouncing around a 1:1 screen, and calculates the time taken to return back to it's starting position and angle depending on the inital angle fired.

This program was used in my research to find a sinusoidal relationship between the initial angle and length of time taken to return to a starting point. I recieved an A on this project and loved working on it
